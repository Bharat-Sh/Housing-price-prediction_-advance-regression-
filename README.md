# Housing-price-prediction_-advance-regression-
This project explores and implements various advanced regression techniques for predictive modeling using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using methods such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost. Each model is assessed using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score to ensure accuracy and reliability. The notebook is structured with clear Markdown explanations to guide readers through each step, making it an excellent reference for those learning or applying regression in real-world scenarios.
